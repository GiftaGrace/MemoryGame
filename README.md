# 🧠 Memory Game 🃏

Welcome to the **Memory Game**! 🧩 Test your memory skills and challenge yourself to match all the pairs of cards. Can you complete the game in the fewest moves? Let's see how sharp your memory really is!

## 📋 Overview

The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game where you have to flip over two cards at a time and find pairs of matching cards. It’s a fun and engaging way to exercise your memory while having a blast!

### Features:
- 12 cards (6 pairs) shuffled and placed face down in a 3x4 grid.
- Flip two cards at a time and try to find matching pairs.
- Count your moves and track how many pairs you've matched.
- Play until all pairs are matched and the board is complete!

## 💻 How to Play

2. **Make Your Move**: You'll be prompted to input the coordinates (row and column) of two cards you'd like to flip.
